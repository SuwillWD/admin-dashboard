# Admin Dashboard

Welcome to the Admin Dashboard project! This dashboard was created to showcase my skills in using CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox for layout design. Throughout this project, I've learned to skillfully utilize these layout techniques to create a visually appealing and functional admin dashboard.

## Features

- **CSS Grid**: Leveraged the power of CSS Grid to create complex and responsive layouts for various dashboard components.
- **CSS Flexbox**: Employed CSS Flexbox to handle alignment and spacing within individual dashboard modules, ensuring a clean and organized design.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented responsive design principles to make certain elements of the dashboard adapt to different screen sizes. While the dashboard isn't fully responsive, I've made significant progress in making key components adjust to various devices.
